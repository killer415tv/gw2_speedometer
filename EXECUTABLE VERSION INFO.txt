Hi! I made the speedometer files as standalone executables, are the same version of the speedometer, checkpoint viewer and ghost viewer of python version
buut these exes dont need python installed, they can run standalone without python, and that is the reason of the 
heavy size of the files. 

Each file has needed python installation files inside.


Github does not allow me to upload such a big files so I put it on mega

https://mega.nz/file/m5VnRACS#WfuFxBV73eIP254wuF_eDW0KDsm8L0jtX25JMy-Ec_c


If someone want to make its own exe file from the source, IDK maybe you dont trust on executables without certificates. You can make this with pyinstaller

source: https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/

just install python, install pyintstaller, and 

pyinstaller -F speedometer_multilap.py


I hope this will help ppl with python problems, and brr brr good luck! see ya
